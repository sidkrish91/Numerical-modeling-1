The folder version1 contains the matlab code implemented for solving a set of ODE's pertaining to 1D pseudo-homogeneous fixed bed reactors for the chemistry of CO2/CO/H2 for methanol production.
Salient features of the code as summarised as below:
a) tested for adiabatic conditions with laboratory conditions as specified in Vanden bussche and froment paper.
b) the above mentioned authors kinetics was tested and simulated with the tested conditions as model parameters
c) the kinetic data was considered as developed by vandenbussche 
d) physical and thermodynamic data such as density, specific heat (of individual components and gas mixtures) was done for inlet conditions only. these parameters where assumed unchanging
e) the code is able to reproduce data for inlet conditions of pressure=50Bar, T=493.2K. 
f) unsteady state model implemented with FDM for discretizing

note:
the coding implemented is for adiabatic fixed bed reactor (temperature gradient is generated with heat of reaction as source.
